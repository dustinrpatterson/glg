#Skills Project for GLG

##Tools I used to create this project - Bootstrap, jQuery & JavaScript, Grunt, Node.JS, Github, Sass, Flexbox, FontAwesome, and Google Fonts.

###Bootstrap
- I used the bootstrap CDN to make the website responsive and mobile-friendly. I learned how to hide certain elements depending on the screen size. This was required to reorder certain elements for mobile devices.

###jQuery & JavaScript
- I used the jQuery CDN & JavaScript to create a function that lets the text show about the picture when you hover your mouse over the grid of photos.

###Grunt
- I've never used grunt before. However, I studied it just for this project and picked up the basics. I used grunt-sass and grunt-concat to demonstrate that I could use it even though it's a little overkill for this one page.

###Node.JS
- I used Node.JS to install grunt, grunt-sass, and grunt-concat. Node.JS also created the package.json file with the dependencies needed for this project.

###Github
- I used github to save my work along the way. I made sure to include a gitignore file to prevent git from saving the large amount of data included in the node_modules folder. Created a gh-pages site as well and this readme.

###Sass
- I've used Sass before, but I've never used it conjunction with grunt. I created a couple variables

###Flexbox
- I used flexbox to help evenly distribute certain elements. You can see it mainly in the nav bar and the footer.

###FontAwesome
- I decided to use these icons. The youtube and instagram icon doesn't match exactly, but we could always use a png file and essentially create our own icon if the client was adamant about using a certain style.

###Google Fonts
- I have never used a custom font file. That being the case, I found a comparable font from google that I imported.

##Questions
- Is redline #13 supposed to be the "hover" color or is that the normal color for the footer section?
- What is the background color for the spacedGrid section? (I used the same color as redline #13)
- How do you load custom fonts?
- The font weight on the carousel title looks to be bolded on the screenshots, but it's not on the redline. Should it be bolded?
- How important is the position of the carousel text box?
- The carousel text box doesn't seem to be mobile friendly. It seems to be an issue with bootstrap as it looks bad even with their default settings.
- Does the client want a favicon for their site?
- Do we have links for what sites to direct the footer icons to?
