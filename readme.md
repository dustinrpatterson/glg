Tools used - bootstrap cdn, jQuery cdn, javascript, grunt, sass, flexbox, fontAwesome icons, google fonts.

bootstrap


jQuery


javascript


grunt
- I've never used grunt before. However, I studied it just for this project. I used grunt-sass and grunt-concat to demonstrate that I could used it even though it's a little overkill for this one page.

sass
- I've used Sass before, but I've never used it conjunction with grunt. 

flexbox


fontAwesome
-I decided to use these icons. The youtube and instagram icon doesn't match exactly, but we could always use a png file and essentially create our own icon if the client was adament about using a certain style.

google fonts
- I have never used a custom font file. That being the case, I found a comparable font from google that I imported

Styling
glg-1 looks to be the "active page class"
glg-3 looks to be the "hover class"
I hard coded "home" in the header as the "active" class by assigning it the glg-1 class

Need to do

-carousel text box
-drop shadow in carousel box text
-Flip image position in spacedGrid when mobile



Questions
-What color should the icon hover color be?
-Is redline #13 supposed to be the "hover" color or is that the normal color for the footer section?
-What is the background color for the spacedGrid section? (I used the same color as redline #13)
-How should I have loaded the custom fonts?
