##Skills Project for GLG

###Tools I used - bootstrap cdn, jQuery cdn, javascript, grunt, sass, flexbox, fontAwesome icons, google fonts.

####bootstrap
- I used bootstrap to make the website responsive and mobile-friendly. I learned how to hide certain elements depending on the screensize. This was required to reorder certain elements for mobile devices.

####jQuery & JavaScript
- I used jQuery & JavaScript to create a function that lets the text show about the picture when you hover your mouse over the grid of photos.

####grunt
- I've never used grunt before. However, I studied it just for this project and picked up the basics. I used grunt-sass and grunt-concat to demonstrate that I could used it even though it's a little overkill for this one page.

####sass
- I've used Sass before, but I've never used it conjunction with grunt. I created a couple variables

####flexbox
- I used flexbox to help evenly distribute certain elements. You can see it mainly in the nav bar and the footer.

####fontAwesome
- I decided to use these icons. The youtube and instagram icon doesn't match exactly, but we could always use a png file and essentially create our own icon if the client was adament about using a certain style.

####google fonts
- I have never used a custom font file. That being the case, I found a comparable font from google that I imported

###Questions
- Is redline #13 supposed to be the "hover" color or is that the normal color for the footer section?
- What is the background color for the spacedGrid section? (I used the same color as redline #13)
- How do you load custom fonts?
- The font weight on the carousel title looks to be bolded on the screenshots, but it's not on the redline. Should it be bolded?
- How important is the position of the carousel text box?
- The carousel text box doesn't seem to be mobile friendly. It seems to be an issue with bootstrap as it looks bad even with their default settings.
